# Exercise 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Problem

Navigate to directory `cl-demo/`. Explore and map out everything in
`cl-demo/`. Draw a tree diagram as in the slide titled Path Diagram.

## Solution

You should see there exists a `README.md` and three directories: `data/`,
`scripts`, and `simulation`.

In `data/` we have `cars.txt`, `diamonds.txt`, and `mtcars.txt`.
In `scripts/` we have `generate_data.R`, `plot_data.R`, `summarise_data.R`.
In `simulation/` we have 592 `.txt` files.

# Exercise 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Problem

Create two new folders in `cl-demo/simulation/` with names `p500` and `p1000`.
Move all simulation results with parameter $p$ being 500 to folder
`p500/`. Similarly, move all simulation results with parameter $p$ being 1000 
to folder `p1000/`.

## Solution

Assuming you start in `cl-demo/`, the commands would be

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd simulation/          # navigate to folder simulation/
mkdir p500 p1000        # create 2 new directories
mv *p500*.txt p500      # move p500 files
mv *p1000*.txt p1000    # move p1000 files
```

# Exercise 3 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Problem

Which flag associated with the shell command `rm` allows you to delete a 
directory containing files?

## Solution

Flags `-r`, `-R`, `--recursive` allow you to remove directories and their 
contents recursively. Flags `-d` and `--dir` only allow you to remove empty
directories.
